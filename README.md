# ZaghaLab-WidefieldTutorial
This tutorial showcases the tools used for pre-processing widefield videos, projecting into low dimension, creating a design matrix, and running multiple regression on neural/behavioral data.

- Ridge regression functions can be downloaded from https://github.com/churchlandlab/ridgeModel
- Example widefield/behavioral data can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pkWcg_YW7DrdqnO32IvYPy1QJSaZwqYg?usp=sharing)
- Before you run the script, open it and enter the filepath for your data (variable is dataFolder, first line of code).
- Make sure to add any new functions to the MATLAB path.
